  			I made a friend who work as a web developer in America on Hellowtalk!
        It was nice meeting haha! I've never had a web developer friend in abroad but I have one now ^_^ so exciting!!

        I've been making a list 'HTML & CSS' and studying about it as well. I felt if I want to teach somone, I should know everything about that to explain.

        Teaching is also learning.
        I'm improving my publishing skill too.
        Happy to feel it!
