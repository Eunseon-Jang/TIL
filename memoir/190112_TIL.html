		<p class="msg">
			I couldn't study much about JavaScript yesterday. But I met with my mentor of exchange studying yesterday! He was reviewing what I learned the past few weeks(unit 1-12 functions). It was very helpful to me because I didn't expect for him to review the things I learned. So it made me feel thankful.

			We are meeting next weekend again to review and study more! :>

			Also, I should learn more about CSS too because I don't have the talent to explain what I want to exactly say well, so I'll practice more.

			Actually, I was quite nervous before having to meet with him because I haven't been taught by someone as stated before.

			I hope to get better when studying. XD
