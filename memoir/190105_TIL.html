  			----NOTE----
  			I've gotten a suggestion of an 'exchange study' from my mentor Hanju today!
			So exciting!!! I've never taught someone so it's quite nervous, but he is smart guy.
			I hope I could be a valuable person to him too!

			I met my ex teacher yesterday to have lunch together.
			He is pretty close with me even though he was my teacher lol.
			So! I'm gonna get some advice about helping someone to teach some skills of HTML and CSS.
			I think he will give me some advice~.
			
			I hope it will be worth it.
