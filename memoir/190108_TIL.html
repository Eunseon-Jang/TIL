		<p class="msg">
			Today I learned about Object of JavaScript.
			Actually, I used to use Object a lot when I make a dummy data in the script, but I've been a little confused between 'Object[property]' and 'Object.property'.
			Now I totally understand everything of Object. It was helpful information to me.

			Thanks https://poiemaweb.com :)!

			I couldn't study English today.
			I'm sorry for myself.ㅜ_ㅜ..
