  		<p class="msg">
  			I feel like it's kind of my diary.
  			So I'll write what I felt, what I did, what I was interested!
  			And what I want to do.

  			Actually, I'm planning to meet my ex coworkers today. So I don't think I can do anything except for writing this kk (Bad excuse~~). But I've decided to make it! And I'm writing this in English even though I'm Korean so it's quite worth it. Isn't It?
  			I've been trying to use English more than before because I want to get a job abroad next year. 
  			So It's necessary to use English in my life.
  			Now I feel like I'm a talkative person haha. I'm going to use the vocabularies what I learned every single day.
  			Now this message seems like written by easy vocabularies but I'll decorate 'Memoir' by many new words and expressions.

  			If you find out about some problem (Grammar, Ineffective programing skills...etc) Please tell me. I want to solve every problem here! Thanks for reading this.
